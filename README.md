# The Docker Workflow

At first, Docker may seem overwhelming. It comes across as an ill-defined technology, that takes space from system automation tools (e.g. Ansible), environment managers (e.g. Vagrant), and even classic virtual machine providers  (e.g. VMFusion or VirtualBox). To me, Docker is a workflow for developing, testing, and deploying applications with much less friction. When I started looking at Docker as a workflow more than a tool, things made much more sense to me.
